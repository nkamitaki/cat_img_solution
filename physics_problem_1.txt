Two solid cylindrical discs, of the same thickness, made of the same material.  Each disc is attached to a rod that goes through its center.  The discs can rotate without friction around the rods.  The two rods are held fixed by an external frame, so the rods can not move or rotate with respect to each other.  The discs touch each other on their outer rims; the friction coefficient of the contact between the discs is mu = 0.9106950312693548.  Disk one has radius R1 = 0.9365490673504131 m and initial angular velocity w1 = 1 rad/s.  Disc two has radius R2  = 0.7416411280509497 m and initial angular velocity w2 = 0 rad/s.  Due to friction between the two discs their angular velocities will change until eventually the friction force becomes zero and the angular velocities no longer change.  What will be the final angular velocity of disc one?
